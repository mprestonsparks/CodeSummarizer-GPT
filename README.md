# JavaScript Code Summarizer

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to automatically generate summaries of JavaScript files in a given codebase. 

## Overview

The script walks through the codebase and processes each `.js` and `.jsx` file it encounters. For each file, it extracts the names of the components defined in the file (if any), and feeds this information into GPT-4 to generate a brief summary of the file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js
- An OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to its directory.
2. Install the required Node.js packages:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following environment variables:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
    CODEBASE_PATH=<path to the codebase you want to summarize>
    ```

## Usage

Once you've set everything up, you can run the script with the following commands:

### Code Summarizer

```shell
python code_summarizer.py
```
The script will generate a code-summaries.txt file in the summaries directory, containing the generated summaries for each .js and .jsx file in the specified codebase.

### Codebase Summarizer

``` shell 
python codebase_summarizer.py
```

`codebase-summarizer.py` is a Python script that generates a tree-like textual representation of your project's directory structure. 


>The generated directory tree presents the files and directories using a unique numbering scheme to easily reference specific elements. The scheme works as follows:
> - Directories are given a single digit (e.g., `(1)`) or a sequence separated by periods for nested directories (e.g., `(1.2)`) and are indicated by a trailing slash.
>- Files within these directories are assigned an additional digit, resulting in a three-part sequence (e.g., `(1.2.1)`). 




## Notes
- The script respects .gitignore and .ignore files, so it will not process files or directories that are ignored by these files.
- The script is currently set up to process JavaScript files specifically, but it could be adapted to handle other languages by modifying the get_components function.

- The initial plan was to take the tree generated by `codebase-summarizer.py` and use `code-summarizer.py` to attach a short description to each item.  
**After that's done, I'd like to find a way to compress the summary into a short enough form that I can prepend my prompts to ChatGPT with it (to improve its accuracy in code suggestions & debugging).**
